# Beer Data Pricing and Clustering Exercise

## Description
This repository contains code for the clustering and pricing, which involves building and deploying a pricing model for beer products. The pricing model aims to optimize beer prices based on various factors such as demand, sales performance, and market trends.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Installing Pip Requirements
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory:

`git clone https://github.com/chasenuzum/naz_data_clustering_pricing.git`
- (not saved in git yet)

`cd naz_data_clustering_pricing`


- Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

`pip install requirements.txt`

### 2. Running the Application
- After installing the dependencies, you can run the `run.py` script to execute the pricing model:

`python run.py`


### Docker Installation (Optional)

#### Building the Docker Image
- If you prefer using Docker, ensure Docker is installed on your system.
- Navigate to the project directory containing the Dockerfile.
- Build the Docker image using the following command:
